#  Thackeray To rake In $1 Million For 2 Nights Of Blackout Bingo

William Thackeray, the British author of "Vanity Fair" and other 19th century classics, is set to make a fortune this week by playing blackout bingo.

For two nights only, the 91-year-old will offer exclusive private games to high-rollers willing to pay $1 million for the chance to win.

Thackeray is no stranger to blackouts - he played his first game in 1956 and has been hooked ever since.

"There's nothing quite like the thrill of watching those last few balls fall and then knowing you've won," he said.

The author has already raked in $600,000 from would-be bingo millionaires, but is confident of bagging the rest before Wednesday night's final game.

His daughter, Sarah, says the family is planning to use the money to buy a new house.
