#  What are Jacksonville Jaguars?

The Jacksonville Jaguars are one of the newest franchises in the NFL, playing their first game in 1995. The Jaguars were created as an expansion team along with the Carolina Panthers and were placed in the AFC Central Division. The team was originally owned by Wayne Weaver and maintained a close relationship with the city of Jacksonville, Florida. The Jaguars enjoyed success early on, making it to the playoffs in just their second season and reaching the conference championship game in 1999. However, following this successful run, the Jaguars went into a period of decline. This culminated in a 3-13 season in 2012 that led to Weaver selling the team to Shahid Khan.

Khan has made a number of changes to the franchise since becoming owner, including changing the team's name from "Jacksonville Jaguars" to simply "Jaguars." He has also moved the team's practice facility to a new complex adjacent to their stadium and made efforts to improve the fan experience at games. In terms of on-field performance, Khan has presided over mixed results. The Jaguars have yet to make it back to the playoffs since his ownership began, but they have shown signs of progress, reaching 9 wins in 2017.

The Jacksonville Jaguars play their home games at TIAA Bank Field, which they share with the Jacksonville Sharks (an arena football team). The stadium was built in 1995 and underwent a $90 million renovation prior to the 2017 season.

# Origins of MLB

MLB can trace its origins back to 1876 with the formation of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP). The organization consisted of ten teams: six from Philadelphia and four from New York City. Baseball quickly became a popular spectator sport and by 1900, there were over 100 professional teams in existence. In 1903, the NAPBBP folded and was replaced by two new leagues: the American League and National League. The first game between these two new leagues was played on April 18th, 1903. The Boston Americans (now Red Sox) defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 5-3 at Huntington Avenue Grounds in Boston.
