#  Bettors Lose Big as Steelers Implode in Week 1

In a stunning turn of events, the Pittsburgh Steelers lost their Week 1 matchup against the Tennessee Titans, 43-27. Bettors who put money on the Steelers to win are now out a lot of money, as the team's odds were at -5.5 points heading into the game.

The Titans took an early lead and never looked back, leaving the Steelers scrambling to catch up. The team's defense was largely ineffective, giving up 439 total yards to the Titans. In particular, quarterback Marcus Mariota had a great game, throwing for 206 yards and four touchdowns.

This loss is a major upset for the Steelers and could have far-reaching consequences for their season. They now face an uphill battle to make it into the playoffs, and their fans are likely wondering what went wrong.

For bettors who lost money on this game, it's a bitter pill to swallow. But it's important to remember that betting is always a risk, and sometimes you lose no matter who you back. This week was just one unlucky break for those who put their faith in the Steelers - hopefully things will go better for them in future matchups.

#  Sports Betting Preview: Steelers Heading into the 2016 Season

The NFL season is right around the corner, and that means one thing for sports betting enthusiasts: it’s time to start thinking about how to make some money off of the upcoming games.

Of course, predicting the outcomes of NFL games is never easy, and there are always plenty of surprises in store from one week to the next. However, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t value to be had in predicting which teams will come out on top.

In this article, we’re going to take a look at the Pittsburgh Steelers and assess their chances heading into the 2016 season. We’ll start by taking a look at the team’s roster, followed by a breakdown of their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we’ll give our predictions for how the Steelers will perform this year.

Roster

The Steelers had a relatively successful 2015 season, finishing with an 8-8 record and narrowly missing out on the playoffs. One of the main reasons for their lackluster performance was their lack of depth; injuries decimated the team late in the year, and they were unable to recover.

This year, things should be a bit different for Pittsburgh. Thanks to some shrewd offseason moves, they’ve managed to build up some depth on their roster, which should help them stay competitive even if key players go down with injuries.

Of course, Pittsburgh is still far from perfect; they have a few glaring weaknesses that could easily be exploited by opposing teams. Let’s take a look at some of those weaknesses now.

Weaknesses

One of the Steelers’ biggest weaknesses is their lack of a dominant running back. Their top rusher last year was DeAngelo Williams, who finished with just 907 yards on the season. This year, they’ll likely be relying heavily on young backup running back Jordan Todman to carry the load. Todman is talented but unproven; he could easily struggle if given too much responsibility.

Another weakness for Pittsburgh is their offensive line. The unit was shaky last year and didn’t do a good job protecting quarterback Ben Roethlisberger from opposing defenders. If this trend continues in 2016, it could lead to disaster for the Steelers offense.

 strengths

That being said, Pittsburgh does have several strengths that could help them overcome these weaknesses during the upcoming season. For one, they have one of the best quarterbacks in the league in Ben Roethlisberger. He’s proven himself time and time again as one of the most clutch players in NFL history, and there’s no reason to believe he won’t continue to thrive in 2016.

#  Bettors Weigh In on Steelers Heading into Pre-Season

For the Pittsburgh Steelers, things are looking up as they head into their pre-season. In particular, their offense has shown a lot of promise with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and running back Le'Veon Bell both looking in top form.

As a result of the team's strong offensive showing in the pre-season, the Steelers have seen their odds to win Super Bowl LIII Improve from +1200 to +900 at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.

This puts Pittsburgh behind only Tom Brady's New England Patriots and reigning champions the Philadelphia Eagles on the list of Super Bowl favorites. And with Ezekiel Elliott's Dallas Cowboys slipping to +1800 after facing some key offseason departures, the Steelers could very well be in line to take home this year's Lombardi Trophy.

Naturally, there is some skepticism around the team given that they have failed to live up to expectations in recent seasons. But with players like Roethlisberger and Bell still in their prime, there is a good chance that Pittsburgh can make a deep playoff run this year.

As far as individual bets go, there are some interesting options available for those looking to back the Steelers. Bell is currently listed as [+225] moneyline favorite to win NFL MVP honors, while wide receiver Antonio Brown is [+600] second favorite behind only Atlanta Falcons star Julio Jones [+400].

And if you're feeling really confident about the Steelers' chances this season, you can put down money on them winning it all at odds of [+900].

#  Pittsburgh Steelers a Popular Betting Team with Las Vegas Odds Makers

The Pittsburgh Steelers have been a popular betting team with Las Vegas odds makers in recent years. The Steelers are always a threat to make a playoff run and they always seem to be in the mix for the Super Bowl.

Last year, the Steelers opened as 100/1 longshots to win the Super Bowl. However, they went on to reach the AFC Championship Game. This season, their odds have shortened considerably and they are currently listed at 12/1 to win the Super Bowl.

There are a few reasons why the Steelers are such a popular bet with Las Vegas odds makers. For starters, they have one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL in Ben Roethlisberger. He is coming off another strong season and he is surrounded by some talented players on offense, including Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell.

The Steelers also have a very stout defense, which was on display during last year’s playoffs. They shut down some of the best offenses in the NFL, including the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars.

While there are some concerns about their offensive line and running game, the Steelers still look like one of the top teams in the AFC this season. They should be able to contend for a playoff spot and they could even make another run at the Super Bowl.

#  Are you Ready for some Football?! Sports Betting on the Steelers Begins

The NFL preseason is in full swing and football fans all over are gearing up for another exciting season. This year, the Pittsburgh Steelers are one of the favorites to make it to the Super Bowl, so sports betting on the Steelers begins in earnest. Here are some tips on how to bet on the Steelers and make some money this season!

First, it is important to understand the basics of sports betting. When you bet on a team, you are essentially stating that you believe that team will win or lose its game. There are a variety of different bets that you can place, depending on how confident you are in your pick. For example, you can bet on the Steelers to win outright, or you can bet on them to cover the point spread.

If you are relatively new to sports betting, it might be a good idea to start out by betting on the Steelers to win outright. This is called a "straight up" bet and is simply predicting that the Steelers will beat their opponent by more than one point. The odds for this type of bet will usually be around +150 or +170, meaning that if you bet $100, you would stand to earn $150 or $170 if your prediction is correct.

If you think the Steelers might not beat their opponent by more than one point, then you could consider betting on them to cover the point spread instead. This is where things get a bit more complicated, but also more rewarding if done correctly! In order to cover the point spread, the Steelers would need to win by more than the number of points set as the spread. So, for example, if the spread was set at -3 points and Pittsburgh won by 4 points or more, then they would have covered the spread and your bet would be successful. Conversely, if they only won by 2 points or less, then they would have failed to cover and your bet would lose.

The odds for covering a point spread will usually be slightly lower than those for picking a team outright to win (around -110), but this type of bet offers much better odds of winning if your prediction is correct. So if you think there's a good chance that Pittsburgh will beat their opponents by more than 3 points but don't want to risk betting on them outright, then betting on them to cover might be a good option for you!

Of course, there are many other types of bets that can be placed on NFL games besides straight up and against the spread bets. You can also bet on how many points each team will score, who will win halftime/the entire game, and even which players will score touchdowns or interceptions. The sky's the limit when it comes to sports betting, so experiment with different bets until you find ones which feel comfortable for you and offer good odds.

Now that we've gone over some basic information about sports betting let's take a look at how to bet on the Steelers specifically. As mentioned before, they are one of this year's favorites so their odds should always be fairly favourable compared to other teams. In general, it is best to wait until just before game time before placing any bets so that you have as much information as possible about both teams' current form and injury status etc.. However with Pittsburgh there may be occasions where early bets offer very favourable odds due its high potential payoff.

One thing worth noting about betting on NFL games in general is that there tends to be less movement in terms of lines compared MLB or NBA games. So generally speaking it is better not to try and guess what line might move in your favour but rather go with what feels most comfortable for you at any given time. With that said however always keep an eye out for discrepancies between online sportsbooks as these can sometimes indicate value bets waiting to happen!
