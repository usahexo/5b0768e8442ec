#  What will be the best video game consoles for 2022?

As we head further into the 21st century, video gaming consoles continue to be more and more popular. Millions of people around the world enjoy playing video games for entertainment, competition, or simply to pass the time. With new console releases every few years, it can be hard to determine which one will be the best for you. Here is a list of the top 3 video game consoles likely to be released in 2022.

#3 PlayStation 5

The PlayStation 5 is likely to be released in late 2020 or early 2021. The console will have improved graphics and a more powerful processing unit than its predecessor, the PlayStation 4 Pro. It is also rumored that the PS5 will be backwards compatible with games from previous PlayStation models. This means that gamers who already own PS4 games will be able to play them on the PS5 without having to purchase them again.

#2 Xbox Project Scarlett

The Xbox Project Scarlett is set to release in late 2020, just like the PlayStation 5. This console is powered by AMD hardware and has 8-core Ryzen processors. It also includes a solid state drive, which will make loading times much faster than traditional hard drives. Another exciting feature of this console is that it will be backwards compatible with Xbox One games.

#1 Nintendo Switch Lite

The Nintendo Switch Lite was released in September 2019 and has been a huge success so far. The console is a handheld only model, meaning that it cannot be connected to a TV like the original Nintendo Switch can. Despite this limitation, the Switch Lite has many features that make it an attractive choice for gamers. These include better battery life, a built-in micro SD card slot, and a lower price tag than the original Switch.

#  What new features will they have?

With the release of macOS Mojave, Mac users will see a number of new features and enhancements to their computer operating system. These new features include an updated dark mode, Desktop Stacks, a redesigned Mac App Store, and more. Let’s take a closer look at some of the most notable new features in macOS Mojave.

# Dark Mode

One of the most noticeable changes in macOS Mojave is the inclusion of a dark mode. This mode reverses the standard white background and light text color scheme used in macOS and replaces it with a black background and light text. Many users find dark mode to be easier on the eyes when using their computer for extended periods of time, and it can also be helpful for those who want to reduce glare from their screen.

# Desktop Stacks

Another enhancement in macOS Mojave is Desktop Stacks. This feature allows users to organize their desktop items into stacks based on file type or other criteria. For example, you can create a stack of photos, videos, documents, or downloads. You can also specify how many items should be displayed in each stack and whether to show icons or previews. This can be a helpful way to keep your desktop organized and tidy.

# Redesigned Mac App Store

The Mac App Store has been redesigned in macOS Mojave with a new layout and easier navigation. The store now includes featured apps, categories, and editorial content on the front page, making it easier for users to find what they’re looking for. Additionally, the store now supports tabs so you can easily have multiple apps open at the same time. And if you have an App Store account, you can now use Touch ID or Face ID to authorize app downloads and purchases.

# Other Enhancements

In addition to these major new features, there are also several smaller enhancements in macOS Mojave that users will appreciate. These include: 

- A new Gallery view in Finder that makes it easy to browse files by thumbnail preview 
- Sidecar support for using an iPad as a second display 
- Quick Actions for tasks like trimming video or adding watermarks to images 
- Improved security with Gatekeeper allowing users to restrict which apps can be installed on their computer 
- Continuity Camera so you can take pictures or scan documents with your iPhone and have them automatically appear on your Mac

#  Who will make them?

The future of technology is always a hot topic of discussion, and with good reason. Many people are curious about what new innovations will be developed, and what they will be used for. Some believe that the development of new technologies will be left to large corporations, while others believe that individuals or small groups of individuals will be responsible for developing new technologies.

There are pros and cons to both sides of the argument. On one hand, large corporations have the resources necessary to develop complex and expensive technologies. They also have the marketing power to make these technologies known to a large audience. On the other hand, small groups of individuals may be more creative and innovative than larger organizations. They may also be more responsive to customer needs and desires.

Which side of the argument is correct is difficult to say. It is likely that both large corporations and small groups of individuals will play a role in developing new technologies. The important thing is that we continue to develop new technologies, so that we can improve our lives and make the world a better place.

#  What games will be available for them?

Nintendo Switch is a video game system developed by Nintendo. As of March 3, 2017, it has been released in many regions of the world. The console's successor, the Nintendo Switch Lite, was announced on July 10, 2019.

The Nintendo Switch is a hybrid console that can be used as a handheld or home console. It was released on March 3, 2017 worldwide. The Nintendo Switch Lite was announced on July 10, 2019, and is a dedicated handheld console without detachable Joy-Con controllers or HD Rumble features.Unlike its predecessor, the Wii U, which could only be used as a home console, the Nintendo Switch can be used as both a home console and a handheld device by removing the Joy-Con controllers from the main unit and sliding them onto the side rails of the device for handheld use or attaching them to the included Joy-Con Grip accessory to use them as traditional controllers.

The Nintendo Switch comes with two detachable Joy-Con controllers,[11] which can also be used independently of each other.[12] Each Joy-Con includes an accelerometer and gyroscope for motion control support,[13] while near field communication (NFC) allows for interaction with Amiibo figures.[14] The right Joy-Con includes an infrared motion camera that can detect shapes at close range.[15] Both Joy-Cons include vibration feedback functionality.[16] A charging grip is available separately that includes a USB Type-C connector and charging circuitry; this attaches to the bottom of the system to charge both Joy-Cons simultaneously.[17] Alternatively, the left Joy-Con can be charged using a standard micro USB cable connected to any USB power source.[18][19]

Games that were released on Wii U such as Splatoon 2,[29] Mario Kart 8 Deluxe,[30] New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe[31], Super Smash Bros. Ultimate[32], and Animal Crossing: New Leaf – Welcome amiibo are also available for the Nintendo Switch. Wii games that were not released on Wii U such as Punch-Out!![33], Super Mario Galaxy 2[34], Kirby’s Epic Yarn[35], Donkey Kong Country Returns[36], Metroid Prime Trilogy[37], Xenoblade Chronicles 3D[38], and WarioWare Gold are also available on the Nintendo Switch through its Virtual Console feature which allows players to purchase and play select games from past consoles digitally.

#  How much will they cost?

Most of the time, when someone is considering getting a tattoo, the cost is one of their main concerns. How much will it cost? How do I find a good and affordable artist?

There isn't really a definitive answer to that question. Tattoos can range in price from $10 to $10,000 or more, depending on what you get done, how large it is, who does it, and other factors.

Your best bet for finding an affordable artist is to do your research. Ask around for recommendations and look at portfolios online. If you can find an artist whose style you like who also has a reasonable price tag, that's a win-win.

As for what you'll need to budget for your tattoo, expect to pay anywhere from $50-$200 per hour. So if you have a complicated design with lots of colors and details, that could easily add up to $1,000 or more. However, there are plenty of artists out there who charge less per hour, so be sure to ask around before making a decision.

Ultimately, the cost of your tattoo will come down to what's important to you and what you're comfortable spending. Just remember that a good tattoo is worth the investment!
