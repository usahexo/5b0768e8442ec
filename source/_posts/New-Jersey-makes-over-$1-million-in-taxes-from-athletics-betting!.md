#  New Jersey makes over $1 million in taxes from athletics betting!

On November 26, New Jersey took in a total of $1,044,609 in taxes from seven weeks of legalized sports betting. Governor Phil Murphy touted the news saying that the state is on track to make much more money off of gambling than expected.

While some opponents to legalizing sports betting had warned that it could lead to decreased revenue from the state’s casinos and racetracks, it now appears that this is not the case. In fact, Murphy says that he now expects legalized sports gambling to bring in $13 million in its first year – far more than the $10 million initially projected.

In order to generate such a hefty sum in taxes, New Jersey has been beneficiaries of a Supreme Court ruling back in May that struck down a law banning most forms of sports betting nationwide. Prior to that decision, only Nevada offered legal sports gambling.

Since then, six other states have followed suit including Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Rhode Island and Mississippi. And with more states likely to legalize it in the coming years, the amount of tax revenue generated by gambling is only going to grow.

Governor Murphy was quick to point out that not only will this revenue help fill government coffers but it will also benefit Atlantic City’s casinos which have been struggling in recent years. In fact, one casino there has already seen a 25 percent increase in business since sports betting began.

#  Athletics betting thriving in New Jersey!

Since the legalization of gambling on sports in New Jersey, the popularity of athletics betting has boomed. Huge crowds are now common at sportsbooks throughout the state, with people eager to place their bets on everything from college football to international cricket.

Naturally, the NFL is by far the most popular sport for gambling, with almost every game generating plenty of betting action. The New York Jets and Giants are both particularly popular teams, with a large number of locals betting on them each week.

But other sports are also proving popular with bettors. The Golden State Warriors’ championship run in 2018 was a big hit with gamblers, while this year’s World Cup was a major event. In fact, some estimates suggest that as much as $380 million was gambled on the tournament in New Jersey alone!

With so much money changing hands, it’s no surprise that the bookmakers are doing very well indeed. In fact, several of them have seen their profits more than triple since sports betting became legal in New Jersey. This is great news for the state’s economy, as it means more jobs and tax revenue.

So if you’re looking for a fun and exciting way to gamble on sports, be sure to head to New Jersey! You won’t be disappointed!

#  Statistics show New Jersey reaping rewards from athletics betting!

The State of New Jersey has been enjoying the rewards generated by legal sports betting, with statistics indicating that it is reaping most of the benefits. In a report released recently by the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement, it was revealed that New Jersey took in over $276 million in bets in the fiscal year 2018. Of this amount, the state earned $24 million in taxes, representing an increase of almost 21% from the previous year.

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy hailed these figures as indicative of the positive contribution that legalized sports wagering is making to the state’s coffers. He indicated that his administration would continue working to “maximize this new opportunity for our state.”

The Division of Gaming Enforcement report also showed that about 78% of all sports bets taken in New Jersey during the fiscal year were placed on professional football games. This indicates that NFL betting is by far the most popular form of sports betting in the state. It is also worth noting that, despite initial concerns among some quarters about the potential for match-fixing, there have been no such problems detected in New Jersey since legalization took effect.

#  New Jersey sees increase in tax revenue from athletics betting

In the State of New Jersey, there has been an increase in tax revenue collected from legalized sports betting. In total, nearly $16 million has been generated in taxes from this past year’s bets. This is a significant jump from the amount generated in 2017, which was just over $10 million.

The main reason for this increase is that more people are now betting on sports. The number of people placing bets has more than doubled since 2017. This can be attributed to the fact that New Jersey has been one of the only states to offer legal sports betting since the repeal of PASPA last year.

There are many who believe that this trend will continue, and that tax revenue from athletics betting will only keep increasing in the years to come. This could be very beneficial for states that have legalized sports betting, as it could help to offset any negative effects that may come from it.

#  New Jersey making money off of athletics betting!

The state of New Jersey is making a fortune by legalizing sports betting, and it could be just the beginning.

According to reports, New Jersey has raked in more than $100 million in revenue from sports betting since it was legalized in mid-2018. This is good news for the state, as it provides a new source of revenue in these tough times.

Not only that, but legalizing sports betting may also help to bring new businesses and jobs to the state. This is because betting shops need employees to staff their outlets, and this could create new job opportunities in New Jersey.

Cowen & Company, a financial services firm, estimates that legalizing sports betting could generate as many as 3,000 new jobs in New Jersey. That would be a big boost to the state’s economy, and it would help to create much-needed jobs.

In addition, legalizing sports betting could help to attract tourists to New Jersey. This is because people who visit the state for its casinos or other attractions may also want to place a bet on a game.

This could be great news for the state’s economy, as tourists typically spend more money than locals do. In fact, a study by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission found that gambling tourism generates about $26 billion in economic activity each year.

So, it is clear that legalizing sports betting can be a boon for New Jersey’s economy. Not only does it provide a new source of revenue, but it also creates jobs and attracts tourists.
