#  1899 Hoffenheim odds to beat Augsburg soar following Robert Lewandowski injury 

With the news that Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski is set to miss the next month with a knee injury, 1899 Hoffenheim's odds to beat Augsburg on Saturday have soared.

Lewandowski is the Bundesliga's top scorer this season with 22 goals in just 23 appearances, so his absence will be a big blow for Bayern. This has led to Hoffenheim, who are currently in 5th place in the table, becoming favourites to win their clash with Augsburg this weekend.

Hoffenheim have been in good form recently, winning their last two matches against Werder Bremen and Eintracht Frankfurt. They will be looking to make it three wins in a row this weekend and could really put some pressure on the teams above them in the table with a victory over Augsburg.

Augsburg, who are currently in 10th place, will be hoping to cause an upset against Hoffenheim this weekend. However, they may find it difficult to do so without their top scorer Lewandowski.

#  1899 Hoffenheim suffers major upset after losing to FC Augsburg 

When the Bundesliga fixtures were announced last month, 1899 Hoffenheim and FC Augsburg would have been considered two of the clubs battling for relegation. However, on Saturday afternoon, it was Hoffenheim who crashed to a shock 3-0 home defeat to Augsburg.

Augsburg’s top scorer Caiuby got the ball rolling in the 37th minute, slotting home his sixth goal of the season after some neat build-up play from team-mates Philipp Max and Michael Gregoritsch. The Brazilian then turned provider for the second goal on the stroke of half time, his cross picked out Ja-Cheol Koo who made no mistake from close range.

Hoffenheim came out all guns blazing at the start of the second half in an attempt to get back into the game, but they were met by a robust Augsburg defence which refused to give them an inch. The visitors then sealed their victory with a third goal in the 73rd minute, Florian Grillitsch turning into his own net after being put under pressure by substitute Alfred Finnbogason.

The result means that Hoffenheim are now just two points above the relegation places, while Augsburg move up to ninth place in the Bundesliga table.

#  1899 Hoffenheim players devastated after blowing Bundesliga title chance 

The 1899 Hoffenheim players were absolutely devastated after blowing their chance to win the Bundesliga title. The club was just one point away from clinching their first-ever Bundesliga championship, but they suffered a devastating 3-1 loss to Borussia Dortmund on the final matchday of the season. This heartbreaking defeat means that Bayern Munich will be crowned champions for the sixth consecutive year.

Hoffenheim started the match brightly and took the lead in the 19th minute through Serge Gnabry. However, Dortmund responded brilliantly and scored three goals in the space of 16 minutes to take control of the game. The Hoffenheim players were clearly dejected after conceding those three quick goals, and they never looked like recovering.

This heartbreaking defeat means that Hoffenheim will have to settle for a place in the Europa League next season. It’s a major setback for this ambitious club, but they will undoubtedly be determined to win the Bundesliga title in future seasons.

#  1899 Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann fined for post-match outburst 

 1899 Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann was fined 10,000 euros ($11,460) by the German football federation (DFB) on Thursday for his outburst after the team's 1-1 Bundesliga draw with Schalke last weekend.

"This is just an apology that I should have given right after the game and not now," Nagelsmann said in a statement on Hoffenheim's website. "I would like to apologize to the referee, who did not deserve my criticism."

The 30-year-old coach was infuriated by what he saw as a number of questionable decisions by referee Felix Zwayer in the match and let his frustrations boil over in his post-match comments.

"Honestly, I think that Felix Zwayer should give up his job as a referee. He simply can't do it," Nagelsmann said.

#  Off could mean curtains for 1899 Hoffenheim's Champions League dream

 Hoffenheim 1899 appear to be in big trouble after a 3-1 home defeat against Leicester City in the first leg of the play-off round for the Champions League qualification.

The Bundesliga side were the better team during the opening exchanges and they got their noses in front when Andrej Kramaric headed them into a 24th minute lead but Wes Morgan's header just before halftime levelled things up heading into the second half.

Shinji Okazaki then put the Foxes ahead 11 minutes from time before Riyad Mahrez sealed victory with a stunning free kick four minutes from time.

And that could mean curtains for 1899 Hoffenheim's Champions League dream with Leicester looking well placed to seal their place in this season's group stages.
