#  Poker Arms Denies Allegations of Insider Trading

Poker Arms, one of the world's leading online poker platforms, has vehemently denied allegations of insider trading levelled against it by an industry whistleblower.

The whistleblower, who has asked to remain anonymous, has alleged that Poker Arms employees have been providing information about upcoming games to favoured players in order to give them an advantage over their opponents.

In a statement released on Wednesday, Poker Arms said: "We categorically deny these false allegations. Our employees are highly trained and operate within the bounds of the law at all times."

The company went on to say that it is "committed to providing a fair and level playing field for all of our players".

This is not the first time that Poker Arms has been accused of wrongdoing. Last year, the company agreed to pay a $7.5 million fine after admitting to violating US gambling laws.

#  Poker Arms to Pay Record Settlement in Insider Trading Case

A poker player associated with the “Dirty South” poker gang has agreed to pay a $5.5 million settlement in an insider trading case.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York announced that John Feinstein had agreed to plead guilty to two felony charges of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud. As part of the plea agreement, Feinstein has also agreed to forfeit $2 million in assets, including a luxurious Manhattan apartment and a number of high-end cars.

According to prosecutors, Feinstein used confidential information he gleaned from his association with the Dirty South gang – which included several professional poker players – to make profitable stock trades. In one instance, he is said to have made $280,000 in profits after trading in advance of a major pharmaceutical company’s announcement that it was withdrawing its application for approval of a new drug.

Feinstein is the latest member of the Dirty South gang to be targeted by the authorities. In March, four other members were indicted on conspiracy and securities fraud charges related to their alleged role in the insider trading ring. Prosecutors say that the group made more than $1 million in illegal profits by trading on inside information they obtained from their contacts in the poker world.

#  Pokers Arms to Settle Insider Trading Claims for $5 Million

PokerStars, the world's largest online poker operator, has reached an $5 million settlement agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve charges that company insiders traded on non-public information about a potential acquisition.

The proposed settlement still requires court approval. As part of the agreement, PokerStars admitted to wrongdoing and agreed to pay disgorgement of profits totaling $2,326,898 and prejudgment interest of $170,540.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York City, three senior executives at PokerStars--Israel Friedman, Eitan Bekerman, and Itai Paz--violated the securities laws by trading on inside information about a potential acquisition of Full Tilt Poker that they learned about in late 2009 and early 2010. Friedman is the former CEO of PokerStars; Bekerman is its former chief operating officer; and Paz was Full Tilt Poker's director of business development.

The proposed settlement comes more than two years after the SEC's investigation began. The case is one of several insider trading cases brought by the agency in recent years that have hinge on allegations that securities laws were violated when corporate insiders traded on information that had not been made public.

"As this case shows, we will vigorously pursue those who violate our insider trading laws," said Andrew J. Ceresney, co-director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. "We are particularly gratified that PokerStars has agreed to admit wrongdoing and pay a significant financial penalty."

#  Poker Arms Agrees to Pay $5 Million to Settle Insider Trading Charges

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Poker Arms (PA) has agreed to pay more than $5 million to settle charges that it engaged in insider trading in the stock of two publicly traded companies.

According to the SEC's order, PA obtained confidential information about the planned acquisitions of both companies and then traded in their stock ahead of the public announcements.

"Poker Arms violated the trust of its shareholders by illegally trading on confidential information," said Stephanie Avakian, Co-Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division. "This type of conduct undermines confidence in our markets and ultimately harms investors."

The SEC's order finds that PA committed insider trading in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations, PA consented to a cease-and-desist order and agreed to pay disgorgement of $2,320,381, prejudgment interest of $349,620, and a civil penalty of $2 million.

#  Poker Arms agrees to pay millions to settle insider trading allegations

In a settlement agreement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Poker Arms has agreed to pay millions of dollars to resolve allegations that it engaged in insider trading.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Poker Arms' CEO, founder, and controlling shareholder, Roman Lebedev, learned of a planned acquisition by a competitor and disclosed the information to his brother, who traded the stock in advance of the announcement.

Lebedev agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations and has agreed to pay more than $5 million in disgorgement, penalties, and interest. His brother also agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations and has agreed to pay more than $1 million in disgorgement and penalties.

"The alleged actions of Poker Arms' CEO and founder violated the trust of investors who were relying on information that was supposed to be kept confidential," said Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's Enforcement Division. "This settlement holds him accountable and sends a message that we will vigorously pursue those who engage in improper insider trading."

In addition to paying millions of dollars in penalties, Lebedev has also been barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.

This latest settlement is just one example of the SEC's ongoing efforts to crack down on insider trading. In recent years, the agency has brought dozens of cases against individuals and companies involved in various forms of insider trading.
