#  How to play Booming Seven?

In Booming seven, the aim of the game is to achieve a hand value of 7. The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. The player is dealt seven cards and the remaining cards are placed face down in the middle of the players. The face up card at the bottom of the stack is turned over to start the turn. On a player's turn they draw one card from either the deck or the middle and discard one. If they cannot discard they must pick up all the cards in the middle and end their turn. The aim of the game is to have a hand value of 7, or as close as possible.

The following are some basic rules:


Kings, Queens and Jacks (court cards) are worth 10 points each

Aces are worth 1 point each

All other cards are worth their face value


The Ace can be used as either a 1 or an 11, depending on what would make a better hand. For example, if you have a 3 and an Ace, you would count it as 4 because 4 is closer to 7 than 11. If you have two Aces, you would count it as 2 because 2 is closer to 7 than 11.


Straights and flushes do not count in Booming seven

If you have two cards of the same rank, for example two Kings, you can either pair them together to make two Kings, or you can use them as separate cards to make a hand such as King-Queen-7-4-3-2. In this case, if an opponent has two Kings also, then neither player would win as both players would have two Kings
