But don’t worry, there are five ways that you can get over a gambling loss and start fresh.</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept it</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step to getting over a gambling loss is to simply accept it. Don’t try to bury your head in the sand and hope that it will all go away – that will only make things worse in the long run. Acknowledge that you lost money and move on from there.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Analyse what went wrong</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve accepted the fact that you lost money, it’s time to analyse what went wrong. What made you bet more than you could afford? Why were you so sure you would win? Understanding where things went wrong will help you avoid making the same mistakes in the future.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Make a plan<br>Bouncing back from a gambling loss takes time and organisation, so make sure you have a plan in place before starting out again. Figure out how much money you can afford to lose each week or month, and stick to that amount no matter what. Additionally, set aside some money specifically for betting, so that if/when you do lose, your overall finances won’t take too big of a hit. </li>
<li>Get help If handling your gambling losses on your own is proving too difficult, get professional help. There are many organisations out there that offer support for people with gambling addiction, so don’t be afraid to ask for help if needed.  5. Take a break Sometimes the best way to get over a gambling loss is to take a break from gambling altogether. This doesn’t mean never gamble again – just take some time off to clear your head and allow yourself time to rebuild your bank balance.</li>
</ol>
